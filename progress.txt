## Initial
- Working on US-001: Investigate Email Provider Configuration
- Checked `sendEmail.js` and saw the `@getbrevo/brevo` SDK setup.
- Found out that the SDK version installed is 4.0.1, which no longer supports `import brevo from '@getbrevo/brevo'` and requires object destruction to get the `BrevoClient` class.
- Fixed the `brevoClient` initialization logic in `sendEmail.js`.
- Passed US-002 and US-003 as testing was successful and the email route returns `200 OK`.
